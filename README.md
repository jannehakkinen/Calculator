# Calculator
Simple calculator project on Android Studio. With the calculator user can do simple calculations and it can be used with android phone. Project is made on Android Studio since it was used on one of our UNI courses and it is coded with Java and XML. All of the code can be found in the master branch and with the paths app/src/main/java/com/example/calculator/MainActivity.java and app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml you can find everything I made. With Android studio one can provide applications to be easily installed to android devices.
